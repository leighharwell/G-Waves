# G-Waves Project
## With data from LIGO and VIRGO on gravitational wave events
### Goal: plot the mass distribution for NS-NS mergers, NS-BH mergers, and BH-BH mergers
**Mass gaps:**
A mass gap is a range of masses where we don’t expect to find black holes or neutron stars 

The Lower Mass Gap (~2.5 to 5 solar masses) 

Neutron stars are the leftovers from smaller stars exploding (supernovae). They’re really dense, but they can’t be too massive, or they’d collapse into a black hole 

Most known neutron stars are 1.2–2.2 solar masses. 

Black holes, formed from more massive stars, usually start at ~5 solar masses and up. 

So the 2.5–5 solar mass range is a weird middle ground where we don’t see anything—not light black holes, not heavy neutron stars. 

The Upper Mass Gap (~50 to 120 solar masses) 

Very massive stars can’t form black holes in this range because of something called pair-instability supernovae. These stars become unstable, explode entirely, and leave nothing behind. 

So, black holes with masses between 50 and 120 solar masses shouldn’t exist—unless they were formed from other black holes merging together. 

These stars are so big that normal supernova mechanisms (like iron core collapse) don't apply in the same way. 

At these temperatures, high-energy gamma rays inside the core begin to create electron–positron pairs. When they turn into electron-positron pairs, that pressure drops suddenly. Now the core collapses inward under its own gravity. The whole star is blown to pieces—no remnant, no black hole, just debris. 

**Chirp Mass:**
The rate at which the gravitational wave frequency increases (the "chirp") is controlled almost entirely by the chirp mass. 

A larger chirp mass → shorter, louder signal. 

NS-NS mergers: chirp mass ~1.2 M☉ → long, gradual chirps 

BH-BH mergers: chirp mass ~10–30 M☉ → short, loud chirps 

Chrip mass can be plotted against redshift data to provide a lookback in time. This can help look for evolution in the population of mergers over time (e.g., were heavier mergers more common in the early universe?)
